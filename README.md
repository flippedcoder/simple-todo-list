# simple-todo-list

It's a stripped down version of a todo list app because I wanted something super light and where nothing needed permissions on my phone.

## Running the app
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into the "client" directory and run npm install
3. cd into the "server" directory and run npm install
4. Open two terminals, one for the "client" and one for the "server"
5. Run npm start in both terminals
